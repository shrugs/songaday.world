I follow Mac stuff obsessively, reading blogs, watching keynotes, the whole nine. But at the same time, I feel ashamed of myself for buying into the uber-super-duper consumerism of it. I mean, it's consumerism ULTRA. Then, with Steve, it's this feeling that, based on everything that I've read of him, based on all of the speeches I've read of his (and I've read most, I think), it just seems to me that someone of his intelligence and sensitivity must also see the raw, unyielding consumerism that he's the King of, and I wonder, does he care? Does he ever question what he's throwing his obvious talent behind? I wonder. Anyway, he's sick and it's really sad imagining a world without Steve Jobs. I hope he gets better. I'd be so curious to know what his inner life is like.",

He was the mayor of Cincinnati. Then he slept with a prostitute. But he was HONEST about it, and was able to get elected a second time. 2. He was just a little baby when his parents bundled him up, and left their home in Germany to escape the Nazis.. His entire family tree was decimated. I think this colors the man.",

    "description": "Here's the request I received: \"I was thinking a song by you would be a great way to apologize to our friends Sarah and Mike who got their bikes stolen from outside our apartment while we were all out getting dinner at the secret bibimbop place (they don't have a store front and it's hard to find, but it's really excellent). We feel extra bad because they're training for a cross country bike trip this summer and now have to buy fancy new bikes. They were super nice about it, but we could tell it really stressed them out.\"",

    "description": "George Tiller, a doctor famous for being attacked for performing late term abortions, was shot and killed today (Sunday, May 31st) by an (as of yet) unidentified gunman...while he was walking into his church. Now, I'm not really sure how I feel about late term abortion, though I very strongly come down on the side of a woman's right to make the most difficult decisions for herself. Either way, the one thing I am one hundred percent sure of is that killing is not the answer. For further reading, please see: http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/f...",

I've been searching far and near for a good, simple, efficient way to distribute my music. And I have finally found it. I've started to upload everything, 12 years worth of material, to www.jonathanmannmusic.com (hosted by Bandcamp). Once I reach the Song A Day project, I'll be making every song available for download. You can download for free, or pay what you can afford...50 cents and higher. Pretty sweet. Check it out!",

It would make me feel all warm and fuzzy and nostalgic. And I LIKE feeling nostalgic. So! Enjoy.",

But before I could sing the song, we had to get Helenmae into the room. So we sang her a song. So Ivory went to go look for her, and then we sang an Ivory song. And then, finally, we sang Helenmae a song. The only real problem is that you can't really see me, and someone was playing a tamborine right near the camera, so it's really loud. Anyway! Enjoy! (Oh, and the actual show went really well)",

Everyone’s got an opinion, no use getting up in arms about it. But MG Siegler’s post on TechCrunch was so nasty, and so high profile, that it seemed like I had to strike back. And so I have. I present to you, “I’m MG Siegler”, in which I throw his words back at him, and more. One note: The part about him blowing his boss…that’s completely made up. I really just wanted to use the rhyme “careington/arrington”. Enjoy!",

The proprietor, an eccentric Berkeley personality named Fat Dawg, has been in the guitar making/selling/trading business since the 70's. He's great. He made me this guitar. It's awesome. i got a new guitar it's silver and it's black i'm gonna play it all the time when i write my songs it'll take me far it's got a wide neck the sound is just so sublime you know that i can't go wrong i got a new guitar it is one of a kind it was made for me by a man called fat dawg i wanna be a a star i wonder if i'm past my prime but i don't know what else to be i'm just me a song hog",

    "description": "this is a song about an android who is completely human in every way, except that his creators didn't see fit to give him a penis, or any other mode of sexual expression. As he grew older, it became more and more of a problem, until all he can think about is having sex. Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure. i was given a soul endowed with consciousness i can pass a turing test with flying colors it's true i'm a machine you wouldn't know unless we fell in love and go to bed i have no genitals why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i am just a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i have precision coordination and i can calculate one hundred trillion processes in under a millesecond I can tear a man in two and believe me, it's crossed my mind for lack of a penis i blame all of human kind why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i'm a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i wanna fuck human or truck i wanna feel flesh a burning wanna be a fucking machine instead i'm devoted to higher learning i got an itch sonofabitch if i can't find a way to scratch it if i could build a mechanical dildo maybe i could somehow attach it on you gave me everything i needed to make my way through this world but the one thing that i wanted you withheld like a jerk so now i will destroy you will all the pent up rage fed by a lustful heart that you locked inside this cage",

    "title": "Quantum Decoupling Transition in a One-Dimensional\r\nFeschbach Resonant Super Fluid",
    "description": "http://jonathanmann.bandcamp.com/trac... I was listening to the RadioLab podcast this morning (if you don't know RadioLab, you should (http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/), and they had They Might Be Giants on. They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called \"Here Comes Science\". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, \"Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid\". Being They Might Be Giants, they did a great job. I decided to pick up where they left off though, and use today's song a day song to write the full song. The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out \"Luttinger\", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay! We study a one-dimensional gas of fermionic atoms interacting via an s-wave molecular Feshbach resonance. At low energies the system is characterized by two Josephson-coupled Luttinger liquids, corresponding to paired atomic and molecular superfluids. We show that, in contrast to higher dimensions, the system exhibits a quantum phase transition from a phase in which the two superfluids are locked together to one in which, at low energies, quantum fluctuations suppress the Feshbach resonance (Josephson) coupling, effectively decoupling the molecular and atomic superfluids. Experimental signatures of this quantum transition include the appearance of an out-of-phase gapless mode (in addition to the standard gapless in-phase mode) in the spectrum of the decoupled superfluid phase and a discontinuous change in the molecular momentum distribution function.",

I'll present you King tree queen tree Just listening to the rustling of their leaves Let's go to scary hill and build a wall of bricks line the floor with maple leaves and the roof is made of sticks These walls these walls protect us from the hill And a car goes by And something is awry Don't take the corner fast you'll end up in the ditch Station wagon families Old folks and drunk teens But up on scary hill there's some kind of witch Do you know me Yes I know you You are the reason I can't sit still I hear the rustling See my breath And I won't follow you up the hill But I'll present you king tree queen Listen to the rustling of their leaves",

    "description": "This one was written by my friend Dan! Who are all these college kids on youtube, doing crazy tricks with ping pong balls? Why dont they do something to improve their lives? Or the lives of humankind. They could bake cookies for their grandmothers, or learn to play the accordion. Or teach ballet to inner city kids, in their free time. I know what your going to say, who the fuck am I to judge anyone else, And what have I ever done, thats worth a shit? Believe it or not the person Im disappointed in the most, is myself. I sleep too late and my hygienes not that good Ive played video games since I was ten and Ive never really saved the world, I know my chances of doing something great are getting fewer, Every time I play bioshock. Ive never watched the sunset with a child, or comforted a burn victim, in ICU. I drink too much and Im so afraid of being alone and dying. My only legacy a waste of space, another masturbator. was Gandhi ever bummed about all the time he spent weaving, Or just staring at the moon. Would Miamoto Musashi have written the five rings if he played grand theft auto? Dont get me wrong, I think the pong tricks are cool, and I cant imagine How hard they are to do. Im just saying how great the world would be, if we committed to caring For each other with the same intensity That we waste our lives.",

    "description": "NOTE: I'm in a video contest, please vote for me! http://ow.ly/1qlPp\r\n\r\nI was super inspired when I saw Merton's now-famous Chatroulette Improv Piano video last week. I had a kind of \"why didn't I think of that!\" moment, and immediately wondered what I could do to sort of build on his idea. And after seeing his interview on Mashable, I knew I had to make a tribute to him. He's really an awesome guy. A lot of what he said there resonated with me, especially the bit about knowing from the start that he didn't want to be mean. \"Mean\" (or sarcastic, ironic, sardonic, etc) is the default position of so many people on the internet; it's nice to see someone who not only thinks that should change, but seems to be embodying that change himself. That's what I aspire to in general, and with Song A Day specifically. \r\n\r\nImprovisation is not really my strong suit. I'm not terrible at it, but I'm a songwriter first and that's how I tend to frame the music I make. After about 2 straight hours of improvisation (which was an exhilarating experience, really, and I'm bound to do it a bunch more), I met Zach and Cloe. After getting to know them a bit, I was able to hit on a structure around which I could build a song. I then took that raw audio file, brought it into Record (the music making program I use) and did what I do daily: produced the song out a bit. \r\n\r\nI really hope you enjoy it. Especially Merton! If he sees it.\r\n\r\nWhat I got in the end is Song A Day #449: Zach and Cloe, Improv Tribute to Merton",

    "title": "Twas the Night Before PAX",
    "description": "So! We made it to Seattle. I came up with the title for this while driving the 3 hours up from Portland. We're staying at the Green Tortoise hostel (if you're around, come say hello!), and I recorded this on my iPhone 4 (with the front facing camera) in my bunk. As is often the case when traveling, I was only able to get one take. We don't have a private room, and folks were coming in and out, making it difficult to really go all out. But Song-a-day is all about making the song where and when I can, no matter the conditions. I'm a little out of tune here, but it's nothing serious (I hope!). \n\nAnyway, I wanted to write a song that really reflected how I feel about PAX. I've only been one other time (three years ago), but it was by far the best convention I'd ever been to (and as GameJew, I went to a lot). It's kind of cliche by now to say it, but this really is the gamer's convention: By gamers, for gamers. There is a palpable sense of family here, that you can just strike up a conversation with anyone you meet, and they could become your lifelong friend. It's almost like summer camp in that way.\n\nLyrics:\n\n'Twas the night before pax and all through Seattle\nEvery manner of nerd was preparing for battle\nPolishing dice and spit shining controllers\nFrom  d n d nerds all the way to wii bowlers\n\nOh pax is for gamers\nIt's where we belong\nAt pax we're not ashamed, no\nFrom ducklings into swans\n\n'Twas the night before pax\nAnd the city exciting\nNew friends on the street\nOld friends reuniting\nFrom near and from far\nWe answer the call\nHead down to gameworks\nHappy hour for all\n\nOh I can't wait to see Warren Spector tomorrow\nAnd all the panels and the talks\nOur Weekend will be Confirmed\nI wanna see the Protomen rock\nJonathan coulton and Frontalot...and don't forget the Minibosses\n\nWanna walk the show floor and be bombarded with swag\nWanna game until I've had my fill\nWanna fall asleep in a big bean bag\nWanna meet a Wheaton named Wil!!\n\nAt pax we are family\nThats the way it is\nWe're the best that we can be\nTogether just like this",

Despite knowing ahead of time that people would miss the sarcasm, the satire, I was still surprised by the amount of people.\r\n\r\nI wanted to write a follow-up song. It's not so much the here-and-now of Terry Jones' publicity stunt, and it never was. It's about the hatred and intolerance that is bubbling back up to the stoplight after, what, 20 or so years of being just beneath the surface. We are not post-racial, we are not post-religion. These people are serious, and the trouble that they're stirring up is bound to have dire consequences somewhere down the line. That was the point of the last song, perhaps a little too subtly, and so here it is, more explicit.",

I'm a huge fan of the Auto-Tune the News guys (and gal) the Gregory Brothers. They are so amazingly talented. I've often thought about trying it myself and using it as a song-a-day video.\r\n\r\nI know that there were probably going to be dozens  (if not more) auto-tune versions of this video, and I wanted to see if I could be the first. So it was created in 3 hours. Even if it's not the best (which I'm sure it won't be!), at least it'll be the first! Which maybe counts for something? Maybe the song should have been longer! Oh well. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in some ways this is actually a really difficult video to auto-tune. There's a TON of background noise, and there are multiple \"singers\" all speaking over each other. I wonder how other folks are going to handle this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a remix, it's actually really simple. There's only 4 chords the whole time: Am-G-F-E    a classic chord progression. The main guy just happened to be speaking mostly in Am. I made it slow because I thought that kind of fit the mood of the tornado somehow. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you're the dudes in the video, please contact me!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\nHoly shit!\r\n(Tornado mother fucker!)\r\n\r\nOh my god I'm gonna get nailed!\r\nOh my god, oh my god\r\n\r\nDude, dude, dude, dude here it comes!\r\n(what the fuck?!)\r\n\r\nHoly fuck! Holy shit!\r\nGet inside now go!\r\nhahahaha!\r\n\r\nDude oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!\r\nlook at that! look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree!\r\nHoly shit! this is fucking crazy! \r\nlook at that !look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree!\r\n\r\nDude, get inside bro...\r\nThe wind, the wind is crazy!\r\nDude, look at it's funneling!\r\nThe wind, the wind is crazy!",

Original video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKfLVyHu_E\r\n\r\nI really love this video. The sheer joy and happiness is infectious. I found this video slightly easier to auto-tune, due to Oprah's voice being so clear (for the most part). I made the decision early on in the process (read: this morning) that I'd just attempt to auto-tune the screaming crowd as well. I'm not sure if that worked so well, but it's interesting for the song-dynamic. Oprah sings, crowd sings, kinda.",

    "description": "Teresa Lewis was the second woman to be put to death by the state of Virginia since 1912. She died on September 23rd 2010. She allegedly hired two gunmen, trading sex for their services, to come into her home and kill her husband and step-son. She also allegedly offered up sex with her 16 year old daughter as collateral for the job.The point of this song is that no human, or group of humans, should be able to take another human's life. They just shouldn't. If she indeed did what they say she did, life in prison would have been an adequate sentence. Killing her solves absolutely nothing. Her daughter, the family member left to grieve, will never have a chance to fully forgive her mother. I find that the saddest part.",

It was awesome and surreal, just as you'd expect from them. A lot of it was just looking at a typical office hallway with random people milling about. Sometimes there were little moments of excitement. ; They had this weird ethereal music playing...I loved that part. I decided I'd write my song a day for them today, and I just randomly started capturing footage. Much to my delight, suddenly something INCREDIBLE happened...",

I collected a bunch of them and made this song!\n\nLyrics:\n\nThere are more atoms in a single glass of water \nthan glasses of water in the oceans of the Earth\nA blue whales heart is the size of a VW Beetle \nand you could swim through its arteries\n\nAn adult human has two to nine pounds of bacteria in his or her body\n\nCleopatra lived closer in time to the first moon landing\nthan to the building of the Great Pyramid\n54 million people alive right now will \nbe dead within 12 months.\n\nfold over a piece of paper 42 times and it will reach the moon\n\nwhat a mad, mad world\nwhat a wonderfully nutty universe\nwhat a glorious space to dwell\nwhat a blessing and what a curse\n\nHydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, \ngiven enough time thinks about itself.\nThe chances are high that 120 years from now, I will not be thought of daily. \nJust another person who lived on Earth.\n\nYou see your nose at all times, your brain just chooses to ignore it.\n\nOptimus Prime and Eeyore were the same guy. \nSame with Megatron and Scooby Do\nDuck Hunt is two player\nA controller in port 2 controls the ducks.\n\nBlue whale is more closely related to a cow, than a cow is to a horse.\n\nwhat a mad, mad world\nwhat a wonderfully nutty universe\nwhat a glorious space to dwell\nwhat a blessing and what a curse\n\nThe age of the observable universe is 13.7 billion years, but it's a sphere with a radius of 46.5 billion lightyears.\n\nEach ejaculation has more sperm than there are people in the united states.\nOne in 5000 babies are born without an anus It's called Imperforate Anus.\n\nOur concept of \"reality\" exists solely in our brain.",

    "description": "A request from my friend Robin! \n\nHer email:\n\n\"The treehouse was built for me and my brother by my dad. It was actually more like a fort - with metal bars you climbed up to get to the 2nd story - which had a railing all around. Then - you could exit from the top by sliding down a fireman's pole, or... climbing down a long, knotted rope.\n\nOn the other side of the structure were two hella long swings! The whole thing was built on the side of a hill, so you could swing waaaaaay out over the hill and jump off the swing, HIGH in the air and fall into leaves at the bottom of the hill. But it was very simple, architectural. Image attached.\n\nAbout two years later, the next-door neighbors built a super fancy hi-tech treehouse even higher up, in a real tree, next door. It had carpet, electricity - really swanky. BUT they were very stingy about sharing it, and it always felt a bit too high up, too scary. \n\nI still think ours was better. It was more like a sculpture you could play on, and it was open to everyone. It had symmetry, and class. It was a real testament to how much our dad loved us and wanted us to have fun - and also, his engineering mind. Maximum fun, minimum materials.. and still as strong the day we moved out as the day he built it.  \"",
